# FirstGame
 First attempt at unity with taylor


To-Do:

1. artwork, artwork, artwork.

2. Hammer out basic game ideas:

    suikoden-esque battle? or more like chrono trigger where it happens on same background.
    how to handle stats and what they mean, i.e. dex if higher than enemy by % will give chance for counter strike or double swings.
    party size and whether they show on screen at all times.
    equipment?
    magic?
    to be continued...

3. get player animations for walking/running

4. figure out how to handle sprite sheets instead of individual files. (blob)

5. figure out camera functions

6. how to handle entity interactions.

7. should battle be on a menu (and what should the menu look like) or controlled by player in real time (star ocean-esque).

8. Do we want AI "free will" battle strategies or pre-made selections of actions. i.e. "viktor" always attacks but "Tuta" always heals if medicine available.
